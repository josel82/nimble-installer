## Preparation

Before running the script:

1. **Update the system packages** (especially on a fresh VM):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x install_nimble.sh
```

3. Running the script
Run the script with `sudo`:
```bash
sudo ./install_nimble.sh
```

4. Registering with WMS Panel
After installing Nimble, register your server with [WMSPanel](https://wmspanel.com/account/sign_up):
Create an account (if you havenâ€™t already).
On the server, run the registration utility and enter your WMSPanel credentials:
```bash
sudo /usr/bin/nimble_regutil
```

5. After Installation
Reboot the server:
```bash
sudo reboot
```
Open necessary ports for streaming (adjust as needed):
```bash
sudo ufw allow 44401:44420/udp
sudo ufw allow 55501:55520/udp
```
You may need to adjust the ports depending on your streaming setup.
